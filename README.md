Gourmet:

As food is the basic need and with changing times it is taking the form of art so in this project we want to use machine learning to approach food and specifically recipes in new ways. For this we will classify the cuisine in categories and taking input from user what all ingredients user have at the moment and our algorithm will give options to the users what all user can cook and what cuisine it belongs to if not selected already. Also, we will include features like what all are the nutrient contents of the selected recipe and calories intake etc. and recommend what all user can also cook if they have missing ingredients, basically in order to give more options if user can arrange few additional ingredients.

MTrack: APPROVED

In this project, we are planning to perform a user based analysis of trends in the music industry. Using this project, we plan to suggest songs to our audience as per their choice. Record labels can also utilize this to suggest songs on the basis of audience preference and may conduct a market research on same. For example, a recording executive can observe our compilation of song tempos across different eras and use that to assess whether there is a correlation between song tempo and popularity. Answering such questions would give record labels a better understanding of what kinds of music will sell.The analysis is performed on song data from few datasets.
