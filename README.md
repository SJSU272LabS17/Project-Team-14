TUX: AN AUTOMATED APPROACH TO 360° BEHAVIOR MODELING

Abstract: The aim of our project is to create an IOT based virtual behavior analyzing software agent  “TUX” which will be installed on your mobile/ smart watch. TUX will use various machine learning algorithms to read,analyze and understand the behavior of an individual using various services as an input such as location service (GPS), calender service, messaging and chat service, buying and selling pattern, search info etc. The output produced by TUX will be behavior based suggestions , reminders, plans, buying and selling capability and many more. TUX will have the capability to provide output in both text and voice form.

The project can be divided in five phases as listed below,but we will be implementing ONLY first two phase under this project due to the time constraints and remaining phases will work as a scope of further improvement.

Phase 1: Using Locations services to analyze your moving pattern and help you navigate at anywhere in the world.

Phase 2: Using Calender services to help you plan your day before it start.  

Phase 3: Using you messaging/chat services to analyze your mood and forecast the your weekend plans.

Phase 4: Using your buying and selling pattern to recommend similar available products with discounts and promotional offers.

Phase 5: using your search,voice communication data to do something amazing which is never heard of.

MTrack:

In this project, we are planning to perform a user based analysis of trends in the music industry. Using this project, we plan to suggest songs to our audience as per their choice. Record labels can also utilize this to suggest songs on the basis of audience preference and may conduct a market research on same. For example, a recording executive can observe our compilation of song tempos across different eras and use that to assess whether there is a correlation between song tempo and popularity. Answering such questions would give record labels a better understanding of what kinds of music will sell.The analysis is performed on song data from few datasets.
